# Soft launch vs hard launch: when and how to post your partner
    
    So you've found someone worth keeping around, and now you're facing the millennial dilemma: when do you make it Instagram official? Let's break down your options.
    
    ## What's a Soft Launch?
    
    The soft launch is your relationship's teaser trailer. Think: two coffee cups, a mysterious hand in frame, or your partner's back facing the camera during a sunset. You're telling the world "I'm taken" without revealing who's doing the taking. It's perfect for the early stages when you're vibing but not ready for your aunt's "when's the wedding??" comments.
<br/>
    **Common moves:** Cropped photos, strategically blurred faces, "someone took me here 😊" captions, or the classic mirror selfie where they're conveniently cut out.
    
    ## What's a Hard Launch?
    
    This is the full reveal—faces visible, partner tagged, probably captioned with something that makes your friends comment "FINALLY." You're going full relationship official, telling everyone from your mom to your high school ex that you're officially coupled up. No more mystery, just pure "look at us being happy" energy.
    
    ## When to Soft Launch
    
    **Weeks 1-8:** If you post at all, keep it whisper-soft. Stories only, very ambiguous. You're still figuring out if they load the dishwasher correctly.
<br/>
    **Months 2-4:** Prime soft launch territory. You're confident this is going somewhere, but not ready for public pressure. Drop those artistic shoulder shots and let your followers play detective.
    
    ## When to Hard Launch
    
    Wait until you can check these boxes:
    <br/>
    - You've had the exclusivity talk (crucial!)
    - You've met each other's friends
    - You're not worried about jinxing it
    - **They're comfortable being posted** (get consent!)
    - You can handle family members asking about marriage in the comments
    - You're past the "discovering dealbreakers" phase
    
    ## The Real Talk
    
    Here's the truth: your relationship's validity isn't determined by Instagram. Some people hard launch after three weeks and thrive. Others stay soft launch forever. Some never post at all.
<br/>
    **The only rules that matter:**
<br/>
    1. Both people should be comfortable with what you post
    2. Don't perform your relationship for likes
    3. Post when it feels right, not because you feel pressured
<br/>
    And remember: whether you soft launch with a cropped hand pic or hard launch with a full couple selfie, your friends will screenshot and roast your caption in the group chat anyway. Embrace it. Love is cringe. Post responsibly! 🚀❤️
