\# Date Ideas in Delhi That Don’t Feel Like a Boring Hangout
		<br/>
		Let’s be honest — dating in Delhi isn’t always wine glasses and deep conversations. Sometimes it’s “AC chalega na?” and “bro where do we even go that’s not boring or broke-core?”
		<br/>
		If you're finally meeting someone from Schmooze who passed the meme vibe check, this list is your cheat sheet. No fake laughter. No overpriced coffee for no reason. Just \*\*fun, chill, slightly offbeat places in Delhi to hang out\*\* with someone you \_might\_ end up soft-launching.

			# 1. Indian Coffee House, CP – Cheap Coffee, Rich Vibe
			You’re not going here for the food. You’re going for the ✨aesthetic✨
			<br/>
			Wooden chairs. Waiters in old-school uniforms. Sandwiches that cost ₹40 and somehow slap. It’s where you can sit for hours and pretend you’re characters in a black-and-white movie — or two interns gossiping about your bosses. Both work.

		\*\*So What’s the Plan?\*\*
		<br/>
		Delhi’s got range — from chaotic dates with MKT momos to slow-burn bookshop strolls. Whether it’s your first meet or fourth re-schedule, one of these is bound to work.
		And if not? At least now you know who’s allergic to spice, afraid of peacocks, or fakes book interest really well.
		Now go schmooze. The city’s waiting.
