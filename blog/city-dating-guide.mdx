# Date Ideas in Delhi That Don’t Feel Like a Boring Hangout
		<br/>
		Let’s be honest — dating in Delhi isn’t always wine glasses and deep conversations. Sometimes it’s “AC chalega na?” and “bro where do we even go that’s not boring or broke-core?”
		<br/>
		If you're finally meeting someone from Schmooze who passed the meme vibe check, this list is your cheat sheet. No fake laughter. No overpriced coffee for no reason. Just **fun, chill, slightly offbeat places in Delhi to hang out** with someone you _might_ end up soft-launching.

			# 1. Indian Coffee House, CP – Cheap Coffee, Rich Vibe
			You’re not going here for the food. You’re going for the ✨aesthetic✨
			<br/>
			Wooden chairs. Waiters in old-school uniforms. Sandwiches that cost ₹40 and somehow slap. It’s where you can sit for hours and pretend you’re characters in a black-and-white movie — or two interns gossiping about your bosses. Both work.
		</LocationCard>

			# 2. Majnu Ka Tilla – Date but Make It a Food Crawl
			Get momos. Get more momos. Try butter tea if you’re brave. Walk around Tibetan lanes full of random boutiques, neon signs, and surprisingly good Korean skincare stores. It’s niche, it’s chaotic, and there’s a 100% chance you’ll find something weird to laugh about.

		<LocationCard src="https://schmooze.in/blog-images/city-dating-guide/lodhi-art-district.png" alt="Date Ideas in Delhi">
			# 3. Lodhi Art District – For When You Both Need a Personality Outside the Internet
			Free, artsy, and full of walls that scream “we’re in our indie era.” You’ll run into pre-wedding shoots, moody teenagers doing Reels, and murals bigger than your future plans.
		</LocationCard>
		<LocationCard src="https://schmooze.in/blog-images/city-dating-guide/sunder-nursery.png" alt="Date Ideas in Delhi">
			# 4. Sunder Nursery – Main Character Picnic Energy
			It’s giving “we bring our own mat and judgement-free snacks” vibes. You can lie under a tree, talk about anything from childhood trauma to conspiracy theories, and maybe spot a few peacocks pretending to mind their business.
<br/>
Bonus: If the date flops, at least you got nature and silence.
		</LocationCard>
		**So What’s the Plan?**
		<br/>
		Delhi’s got range — from chaotic dates with MKT momos to slow-burn bookshop strolls. Whether it’s your first meet or fourth re-schedule, one of these is bound to work.
		And if not? At least now you know who’s allergic to spice, afraid of peacocks, or fakes book interest really well.
		Now go schmooze. The city’s waiting.

# Date Ideas in Mumbai That Don’t Feel Like a Boring Hangout
		<br/>
		Let’s be real — dating in Mumbai isn’t just about sunsets and sea breeze. Sometimes it’s “yaar, traffic mein phas gaye” and “is this café aesthetic enough for a story?”
		<br/>
If you’ve matched with someone on Schmooze who actually gets your memes and your sarcasm, here’s a list of date ideas that won’t bore you or break your wallet. No awkward silences. No overpriced drinks. Just pure Mumbai energy — chaotic, romantic, and a little sweaty

		<br/>
		<LocationCard src="https://schmooze.in/blog-images/city-dating-guide/indian-coffee-house.png" alt="Date Ideas in Delhi">
			# 1. Carter Road or Bandstand – The OG Walk & Talk Combo
			You can’t go wrong with a sea-facing stroll. The breeze is flirting for you, the waves are clapping, and you’re pretending you don’t care about the stray dogs following you.
			<br/>
Walk, snack, people-watch, trauma-dump — in that order. Bonus: you’ll instantly know if they’re a fast walker (red flag).
		</LocationCard>

			# 2. Marine Drive at Sunset – The Classic That Never Misses
Yes, it’s cliché. But it’s also elite. Grab some corn or ice cream, sit by the sea, and let the conversation drift between “this view is insane” and “so… what are we?”
			<br/>
It’s giving Bollywood montage energy — minus the violin background score.

			# 3. Kala Ghoda or Fort – The Pretend-We’re-Artsy Date
Walk through narrow lanes full of galleries, bookstores, and random vintage buildings that scream “old money aesthetic.”
			<br/>
You don’t need to know art — just nod seriously and say “wow, that’s so layered.” Works every time.
		</LocationCard>

			# 4. Colaba Causeway – The Chaos Bonding Test
If you can survive shopping crowds together, congrats — you’re basically married.
			<br/>
Try bargaining, people-watch, and rate random outfits like it’s a sport. It’s messy, loud, and somehow still romantic.
		</LocationCard>
**So What’s the Plan?**
		<br/>
Mumbai’s full of moods — from chaotic to calm, from “let’s just walk” to “let’s soft launch.” Whether it’s a first meet or a fifth almost-date, one of these will hit.
And if it doesn’t? At least you got a sunset, a story, and someone to meme about later.
		Now go schmooze. The city’s waiting.
